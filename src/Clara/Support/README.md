Clara\Support
=============

This area is for support classes: data structures, extremely generalized APIs, and other 'meta' classes that don't fit into another namespace.


NOTE
----

Please don't use this namespace as a dumping ground. There shouldn't be more than a half dozen or so classes in here. Try to keep everything organized into the right namespace.
